# Project Overview

Project Name: Mock Hello World

Description: A simple webpage demonstrating basic interactivity with a "Hello, World!" message. The app includes mocked features to simulate user input and dynamic updates without actual data processing.

Features:

*   Dynamic Greeting: A heading displays "Hello, World!" initially.
*   Mock Button: A button that, when clicked, cycles through different "Hello" messages (e.g., "Hello, Universe!", "Hello, GenStack!"). The changes are client-side and don't persist.
*   Mock Name Input: A form with a name field. Entering a name and submitting the form will *visually* update the greeting to "Hello, [Name]!" but the data is not saved or sent anywhere.

Target Audience: Beginners learning web development concepts or anyone wanting a quick and visually engaging "Hello, World!" example.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the webpage.
*   Client-side JavaScript for the mocked interactivity.
